name: Test Docker-in-Docker Runtime Installation
# Test Docker-in-Docker Runtime Installation
#
# This workflow tests Docker-in-Docker with RUNTIME installation instead of build-time installation.
# This approach tests whether the Docker installation process itself works within containers
# and provides insights into network connectivity during the installation phase.
#
# Key Differences from build-time approach:
# 1. Base image contains only Ubuntu 24.04 + basic tools
# 2. Docker is installed at runtime when container is running
# 3. Tests both installation process and final functionality
# 4. Provides more granular debugging of network issues
#
# Expected Benefits:
# - Tests network connectivity during installation phase
# - Verifies package manager works for Docker repository access
# - Confirms GPG key download and repository setup
# - Validates complete Docker installation workflow
#
# References:
# - docs/SOLUTION-docker-in-docker.md (build-time installation success)
# - Comparison test to understand installation vs runtime differences
