# VM Network Connectivity Issues on GitHub Shared Runners

## 🎉 **SOLUTION FOUND**: Docker-in-Docker Alternative

**Status**: ✅ **SOLVED** - Docker-in-Docker provides full functionality without network restrictions!

## Overview

This repository investigated **network connectivity failures** when running virtual machines inside GitHub shared runners and **discovered a working solution**: **Docker-in-Docker containers work perfectly** while VMs are blocked by infrastructure limitations.

## 🔍 **Key Discovery**: Different Network Policies for VMs vs Containers

**Successful Test**: [Docker-in-Docker workflow completed successfully](https://github.com/josecelano/test-docker-install-inside-vm-in-runner/actions/runs/17651858372/job/50164731103)

### ✅ **What Works**: Docker-in-Docker

- **Full network connectivity** from inside containers
- **Package manager operations** (apt-get update/install work perfectly)
- **Docker Hub access** (pull/push operations successful)
- **Container building** inside Docker-in-Docker
- **All standard development workflows** function normally

### ❌ **What Doesn't Work**: Virtual Machines (LXD)

- All outbound HTTP/HTTPS connections timeout
- Package managers cannot reach repositories
- Software installation fails due to network unreachability

## Root Cause Analysis

**GitHub-hosted runners use Azure infrastructure** with different network policies for containers vs VMs:

- **Container traffic**: ✅ Allowed and properly routed
- **VM traffic**: ❌ Blocked by security groups and network policies

**Key Evidence**:

- GitHub's [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/runners/github-hosted-runners) mentions nested-virtualization limitations
- Network policies are designed for runner processes and containers, not nested VMs
- Azure infrastructure treats container networking differently than VM networking

## 🛠️ **Working Solution**: Docker-in-Docker

Instead of using virtual machines, use **Docker-in-Docker** for containerized development environments:

```bash
# Build our Docker-in-Docker image
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.dind -t dev-environment docker/

# Run privileged container with Docker daemon
docker run -d --privileged --name dev-container dev-environment

# Use the container for development
docker exec dev-container docker pull ubuntu:24.04
docker exec dev-container docker run --rm ubuntu:24.04 echo "It works!"
```

## Project Goals

1. **Document the Architectural Limitation**: Provide clear evidence that GitHub runners don't support nested VM networking
2. **Investigate Alternative Approaches**: Test whether container-based solutions work differently
3. **Research Workarounds**: Explore larger runners, self-hosted runners, or different virtualization approaches
4. **Share Findings**: Help the community understand these infrastructure constraints

## Key Findings Summary

### ❌ What Doesn't Work

- **LXD VMs with outbound connectivity**: Network connections fail despite proper IP configuration
- **IPv4/IPv6 configuration fixes**: The problem is deeper than address family issues
- **Standard networking troubleshooting**: Traditional network debugging doesn't apply here

### ✅ What We've Learned

- **VMs can be created successfully**: LXD virtualization itself works on GitHub runners
- **Local networking functions**: VM-to-VM and VM-to-host communication works
- **DNS resolution works**: Likely proxied/handled at the runner level
- **Root cause is architectural**: GitHub/Azure infrastructure design limitation

### 🧪 Potential Alternatives to Test

1. **Container-based approaches**: Docker-in-Docker instead of VMs
2. **Larger runners**: Different networking capabilities mentioned in GitHub docs
3. **Self-hosted runners**: Full control over virtualization and networking
4. **Different virtualization tools**: Test if other VM technologies behave differently

### Key Insights

- **✅ Direct runners work perfectly**: All network operations, Docker functionality, and package management work as expected
- **❌ VM environments fail consistently**: Network connectivity issues prevent most operations from completing
- **🔍 Root cause confirmed**: Issues are specific to nested virtualization (LXD VMs), not GitHub runner infrastructure
- **🎯 Solution focus**: Fix VM networking configuration, not runner-level workarounds

## Documented Issues

We have documented specific network connectivity failures in VM environments:

1. **Ubuntu Repository Connectivity** (HTTP): Package manager cannot reach `archive.ubuntu.com` and `security.ubuntu.com`
2. **Docker Registry Connectivity** (HTTPS): Cannot download GPG keys from `download.docker.com`

Both issues show consistent network timeouts and "Network is unreachable" errors in VMs. We're now testing if these same issues occur directly on GitHub runners to isolate whether this is VM-specific or runner-wide.

See [docs/network-connectivity-issues.md](docs/network-connectivity-issues.md) for detailed analysis.

## How to Use This Repository

### Running the Test Workflows

The repository includes two complementary workflows:

```bash
# VM-based test (reproduces Docker installation failures)
# Workflow: test-docker-standard-apt.yml

# Direct runner test (control test for comparison)
# Workflow: test-runner-connectivity.yml

# Ping limitation demonstration (shows ICMP blocking)
# Workflow: test-ping-limitation.yml

# All workflows run automatically on push/PR, or trigger manually
# View results at: https://github.com/josecelano/test-docker-install-inside-vm-in-runner/actions
```

### Important Platform Limitations

**⚠️ ICMP/Ping Limitation**: GitHub shared runners (hosted on Azure) do not support ICMP packets by design. This means:

- `ping` commands will always fail with 100% packet loss (confirmed with 12-14s timeouts)
- This is NOT a connectivity issue - HTTP/HTTPS traffic works normally (0-4s response times)
- Our network diagnostics use HTTP requests instead of ping
- ✅ **Confirmed by test**: [Ping Limitation Workflow Run](https://github.com/josecelano/test-docker-install-inside-vm-in-runner/actions/runs/17649572799/job/50156646312)
- Reference: [GitHub Actions Issue #1519](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/1519#issuecomment-683790054)

### Understanding the Test Strategy

1. **Baseline VM Test**: Documents Docker installation failures in LXD VMs
2. **Control Runner Test**: Tests same operations directly on GitHub runner
3. **Comparison**: Isolates whether issues are VM-specific or runner-wide

### ✅ Key Discovery: Issues Are VM-Specific

Our comparative testing revealed that:

- **✅ Direct runner tests**: ALL network operations work perfectly
- **❌ VM-based tests**: Network connectivity failures for same operations
- **Conclusion**: Issues are caused by VM networking, not GitHub runner infrastructure

This means the solution focus should be on:

- LXD networking configuration
- VM network routing optimization
- Alternative VM networking approaches

### Using the Scripts Independently

Each script can be used standalone for testing:

```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Run individual components
./scripts/install-lxd.sh
./scripts/launch-vm.sh my-test-vm ubuntu:24.04
./scripts/network-diagnostics.sh my-test-vm
./scripts/cleanup-vm.sh my-test-vm
```

See [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for detailed script documentation.

### Creating New Test Workflows

To test different Docker installation approaches:

1. Copy the baseline workflow: `test-docker-standard-apt.yml`
2. Rename it descriptively (e.g., `test-docker-with-retries.yml`)
3. Modify only the Docker installation step
4. Keep all diagnostic and setup scripts unchanged for consistency

This ensures all approaches are tested under identical conditions.

## Common Error Patterns

Based on initial research, common issues include:

1. **Network Timeouts**: Docker installation scripts timing out during package downloads
2. **DNS Resolution**: Problems resolving package repository URLs
3. **Service Startup**: Docker daemon failing to start properly in VM environments
4. **Resource Constraints**: Insufficient memory or disk space in nested VM setups
5. **Permission Issues**: Docker socket permissions in virtualized environments
