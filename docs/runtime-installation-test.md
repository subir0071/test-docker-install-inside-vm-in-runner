# Docker-in-Docker Runtime Installation Test

This document describes the runtime Docker installation testing approach as a variant of the successful Docker-in-Docker solution.

## Overview

While the build-time Docker installation (documented in [solution-docker-in-docker.md](solution-docker-in-docker.md)) has been proven to work successfully, this test validates whether Docker can be installed at **runtime** within a container, providing additional insights into:

1. Network connectivity during the installation process
2. Package manager functionality within containers
3. GPG key download and repository setup
4. Docker daemon startup in runtime environments

## Files Structure

```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ install-docker-runtime.sh   # Runtime Docker installation script
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile.dind            # Original build-time installation (successful)

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test-docker-in-docker.yml       # Original build-time test (successful)
```

## Test Architecture

### Base Container (Dockerfile.runtime)

- **Base:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- **Pre-installed:** Basic networking tools, curl, supervisord
- **Missing:** Docker (installed at runtime)
- **Purpose:** Clean environment to test installation process

### Runtime Installation Script (install-docker-runtime.sh)

- **GPG Key:** Downloads Docker's official GPG key
- **Repository:** Adds Docker's official Ubuntu repository
- **Installation:** Installs Docker CE and related packages
- **Daemon:** Configures and starts Docker daemon via supervisord
- **Verification:** Tests Docker installation success

### Test Workflow (test-docker-runtime-install.yml)

- **Build Phase:** Creates base Ubuntu container
- **Runtime Phase:** Installs Docker within running container
- **Test Phase:** Validates Docker functionality
- **Comparison:** Compares with build-time installation approach

## Expected Test Results

### Success Scenario

If runtime installation works (expected based on build-time success):

```
‚úÖ Base container creation: SUCCESS
‚úÖ Network connectivity before installation: FUNCTIONAL
‚úÖ Docker GPG key download: SUCCESS
‚úÖ Docker repository setup: SUCCESS
‚úÖ Docker package installation: SUCCESS
‚úÖ Docker daemon startup: SUCCESS
‚úÖ Docker operations (pull/run): SUCCESS
‚úÖ Container building inside DinD: SUCCESS
```

### Potential Failure Points

Areas where runtime installation might differ from build-time:

- **Network policies during installation**
- **Package manager timeouts**
- **GPG key download restrictions**
- **Repository access limitations**
- **Daemon startup timing issues**

## Key Differences from Build-time Installation

| Aspect                       | Build-time Installation | Runtime Installation        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **When Docker is installed** | During image build      | After container start       |
| **Network requirements**     | Build-time connectivity | Runtime connectivity        |
| **Installation visibility**  | Hidden in image layers  | Visible in container logs   |
| **Debugging capability**     | Limited to build logs   | Full runtime inspection     |
| **Startup time**             | Fast (pre-installed)    | Slower (installation delay) |
| **Resource usage**           | Build-time resources    | Runtime resources           |

## Use Cases for Runtime Installation

### Development Scenarios

1. **Dynamic Docker installation** based on configuration
2. **Different Docker versions** per environment
3. **Installation debugging** and troubleshooting
4. **Network connectivity testing** during installation

### Testing Scenarios

1. **Installation process validation**
2. **Network policy impact analysis**
3. **Package manager functionality testing**
4. **GPG key and repository access verification**

## Running the Test

### Manual Test Execution

```bash
# Build base image
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.runtime -t ubuntu-base:24.04 docker/

# Run container
docker run -d --privileged --name test-runtime ubuntu-base:24.04 sleep infinity

# Install Docker at runtime
docker cp docker/install-docker-runtime.sh test-runtime:/usr/local/bin/
docker exec test-runtime /usr/local/bin/install-docker-runtime.sh

# Test Docker functionality
docker exec test-runtime docker run hello-world
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow

```bash
# Trigger the workflow
git push origin main  # (if workflow files are modified)
# Or manually trigger via GitHub Actions UI
```

## ‚úÖ TEST RESULTS: Runtime Installation SUCCESS!

**Workflow**: [Runtime installation test completed successfully](https://github.com/josecelano/test-docker-install-inside-vm-in-runner/actions/runs/17652148460/job/50165698210) ‚úÖ

**Execution Time**: 1m 31s (Total workflow time)

### üéâ All Test Steps Passed:

| Scenario                    | Recommended Method      | Reason                              |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Production CI/CD**        | Build-time installation | Faster startup, pre-validated       |
| **Development Environment** | Either method           | Both work identically               |
| **Debugging Installation**  | Runtime installation    | Better visibility into process      |

| **Testing/Validation**      | Runtime installation    | Verify installation process         |

## ‚úÖ Next Steps: Both Methods Confirmed Working

### **Implementation Guide**

**For Build-time Installation:**

- Use existing `docker/Dockerfile.dind`
- Follow [solution-docker-in-docker.md](solution-docker-in-docker.md)

**For Runtime Installation:**

- Use `docker/Dockerfile.runtime` + `docker/install-docker-runtime.sh`
- Follow manual steps or use workflow as template

### **Hybrid Approaches Available**

1. **Base image** + **runtime customization**: Install specific Docker versions at runtime
2. **Conditional installation**: Install Docker only when needed
3. **Multi-environment support**: Different Docker configurations per environment
