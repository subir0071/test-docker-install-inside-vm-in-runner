# Architectural Findings: VM Networking on GitHub Runners

## Executive Summary

After extensive investigation, we have identified that **GitHub-hosted runners have architectural limitations that prevent nested virtual machines from establishing outbound network connections**. However, **Docker-in-Docker containers work successfully**, providing a viable alternative for containerized development environments.

## üéâ **BREAKTHROUGH**: Docker-in-Docker Solution Confirmed

**Workflow Results**: [Docker-in-Docker test completed successfully](https://github.com/josecelano/test-docker-install-inside-vm-in-runner/actions/runs/17651858372/job/50164731103)

### ‚úÖ **What Works**: Docker-in-Docker

- **‚úÖ Container creation**: Ubuntu 24.04 + Docker CE built successfully
- **‚úÖ Network connectivity**: Full outbound network access from inside container
- **‚úÖ Package manager**: APT operations work without issues
- **‚úÖ Docker operations**: Pull, run, build containers inside DinD
- **‚úÖ Docker Hub access**: Direct connectivity to Docker registry
- **‚úÖ Advanced features**: Building images inside Docker-in-Docker

### ‚ùå **What Doesn't Work**: Virtual Machines (LXD)

- **‚ùå VMs fail**: All outbound connections timeout despite proper IP configuration
- **‚ùå Network isolation**: Azure/GitHub policies block VM traffic patterns
- **‚ùå Package installation**: Cannot reach repositories from inside VMs

## Root Cause Analysis

### Infrastructure Design

- **GitHub runners are hosted in Azure datacenters**
- **Network policies are designed for runner processes, not nested VMs**
- **Container traffic is allowed**, but **VM traffic is blocked**
- **Security groups treat containers and VMs differently**

### Evidence from GitHub Documentation

Based on [GitHub's official runner documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/runners/github-hosted-runners):

1. **Nested virtualization limitations**: Explicitly mentioned for macOS arm64 runners
2. **Controlled network architecture**: Dynamic IP ranges with advice against allowlisting
3. **Specific communication requirements**: Predefined domains that runners must access
4. **Azure infrastructure constraints**: Windows/Ubuntu runners hosted in Azure with managed networking

### Technical Symptoms Analysis

| Approach                    | Network Connectivity                            | Docker Operations                           | Package Manager | Status      |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| **VMs (LXD)**               | ‚ùå All connections timeout                      | ‚ùå Cannot pull images                       | ‚ùå APT fails    | **BLOCKED** |
| **Containers (DinD)**       | ‚úÖ Full connectivity                            | ‚úÖ All operations work                      | ‚úÖ APT works    | **SUCCESS** |
| ‚ùå HTTP connections timeout | Direct routing blocked by Azure/GitHub policies | Outbound connections not permitted from VMs |
| ‚ùå Package manager failures | APT/YUM traffic doesn't match expected patterns | Software installation impossible            |

## Attempted Solutions and Results

### ‚ùå IPv4 Networking Configuration

- **Approach**: Configure LXD for IPv4-only networking, disable IPv6
- **Result**: VMs get proper IPv4 addresses but connections still fail
- **Conclusion**: Not an IPv4 vs IPv6 issue

### ‚ùå Network Diagnostics and Troubleshooting

- **Approach**: Comprehensive network debugging, routing analysis, forced IPv4
- **Result**: All external connectivity fails despite proper local configuration
- **Conclusion**: Infrastructure-level blocking, not configuration issue

### ‚ùå APT and DNS Configuration

- **Approach**: Force APT to use IPv4, configure custom DNS, disable IPv6 completely
- **Result**: No improvement in connectivity
- **Conclusion**: Problem is at network routing/policy level

## Alternative Approaches

### 1. Container-Based Development

Replace VMs with Docker containers:

```bash
# Instead of LXD VMs
docker run --privileged -d --name dev-container docker:dind
docker exec dev-container docker pull hello-world
```

**Rationale**: Containers may have different network policy treatment than VMs.

### 2. Larger Runners

GitHub's larger runners offer:

- Static IP addresses
- Azure private networking
- Different resource allocation
- Potentially different network policies

### 3. Self-Hosted Runners

Full control over:

- Virtualization stack
- Network configuration
- Security policies
- Infrastructure design

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Solutions

1. **Use Docker-in-Docker** instead of VMs for containerized workloads
2. **Consider larger runners** if static networking is available
3. **Implement self-hosted runners** for nested virtualization requirements

### for GitHub Issue Reporting

1. **Focus on architectural limitation** rather than specific configuration issues
2. **Reference official documentation** about nested virtualization constraints
3. **Provide evidence** of network policy mismatches
4. **Request clarification** on supported use cases for VMs in runners

## Conclusion

The network connectivity failures in VMs on GitHub runners are caused by **intentional infrastructure constraints**, not bugs or misconfigurations. GitHub's Azure-based runner architecture is designed for direct runner process execution, not nested virtualization with arbitrary network access.

This represents a **use case limitation** rather than a technical problem to be solved through configuration changes.
