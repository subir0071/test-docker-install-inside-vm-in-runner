# Solution Research Documentation

This directory contains research and documentation for different approaches to solve the network connectivity issues in VMs running inside GitHub shared runners.

## Research Areas

### 🔍 Active Investigations

- **[IPv6 Connectivity Issues](./01-ipv6-connectivity-fix.md)**: Investigating whether the lack of IPv4 addresses in VMs is causing network failures

### 📋 Planned Investigations

- **LXD Bridge Configuration**: Alternative bridge setups and network configurations
- **Docker Installation Methods**: Alternative installation approaches (snap, convenience script, etc.)
- **Network Retry Mechanisms**: Implementing robust retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Pre-cached Dependencies**: Avoiding network calls during installation
- **IPv4-Only Network Configuration**: Forcing IPv4-only networking in VMs

## Research Template

Each solution investigation should follow this structure:

1. **Problem Analysis**: Clear description of the issue being addressed
2. **Hypothesis**: What we think might be causing the problem
3. **Research**: External references, GitHub issues, documentation
4. **Implementation**: Practical solution approach
5. **Testing**: Workflow/script to validate the solution
6. **Results**: Findings and conclusions
7. **Next Steps**: Follow-up actions based on results

## Status Legend

- 🔍 **Active**: Currently being investigated
- ✅ **Validated**: Solution confirmed to work
- ❌ **Ineffective**: Tested but doesn't solve the issue
- 📋 **Planned**: Scheduled for future investigation
- ⏸️ **Paused**: Investigation temporarily suspended
